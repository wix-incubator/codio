## About
Codio is a media format for recording the process of programming.

The format is composed of code editor operations and audio/video.

A codio recorder allows you to record the proccess of programming inside an IDE with an accompanying audio commentary. A codio player will playback that recording inside another IDE.

## Why?

Codio was created out of a desire to imporve learning infrastructure.

Communication tools are core to learning.

Codio aims to be a medium for effortless creation of explorable and interactive communication between programmers.

## Use cases

Codio is a new media format and as such enables a new medium of communication. As with every new medium, it is hard to predict which use cases will have the greatest benefit.

Here are a few that seem reasonable:

### Tutorials

Recording tutorials in Codio is the easiest way to make your tutorial explorable and interactive.

Being able to play a recording inside an IDE means that the learner can always pause and interact with the code.

It also means he can use his own tools and environment immediately.

### Messaging

Codio opens a completely new way of async communication between programmers. Recording codio messages is effortless and the messages contain dynamic information that is otherwise hard to convey.

### Documentation
Codio could be used to enhance code by appending codios to specific functions or libraries as help.
