## About
Codio is a media format for recording the process of programming.

It its essence, the format is composed of code editor input with an audio/video stream.

A codio recorder allows you to record the process of writing any king of code inside an IDE with an accompanying audio or video commentary. A codio player will playback that recording inside another IDE.

## Why?

Codio was created out of a desire to improve the learning infrastructure.

We strongly believe that communication tools are essential for a great learning experience to take place.

Which is why Codio is envisioned as a medium to enable effortless creation of explorable and interactive communication between programmers.

## Use cases

Codio is a new media format, and as such it enables a new medium of communication. As with every new medium, it is hard to predict which use cases will prove to deliver the best benefits.

There are, however, multiple use-cases start with:

### Tutorials

Recording tutorials in Codio is the easiest way to make your tutorial searchanbe and interactive.

Being able to play back a recording inside an IDE means that the student can always pause and interact with the code.

It also means they can use their own tools and environment immediately.

### Messaging

Codio creates a completely new way of async communication between programmers. Recording codio messages is effortless and messages contain dynamic information that is otherwise hard to convey.

<!--- TODO - can we have an example here? An example would be so great! --->

### Documentation
Codio can be used to enhance any type of docs  by appending codios to help explain specific functions or libraries.
<!--- TODO - Let's ask people for input, like maybe add something like this:

### Your option

Since codio is brand new, we'll be thrilled to hear from you about your experience of working with the format! Let us know at [link, or email or link to an issue, or to some forum, something like that here].
